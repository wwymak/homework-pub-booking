# Writing Custom Actions in Rasa

Custom actions run Python code when a flow reaches an `action` step — for example,
calling an external API, querying a database, or computing a value. They execute on an
action server that communicates with the Rasa server via HTTP or gRPC.

**Key principle**: keep business logic in flows, not in actions. Flows define *how* the
conversation proceeds (branching, conditions, collect steps). Actions do the *raw work*
(fetch data, call APIs, query databases) and return results via `SlotSet` events for
flows to use. Keep each action focused on one responsibility — `action_search_products`
searches, `action_place_order` places an order.

If all you need is a simple API call with slot-based input/output mappings and the API
is available on an MCP server, consider using an MCP tool call instead — see
`rasa-calling-mcp-tools-from-flows`.

## Workflow

1. Identify what raw work the flow needs — API call, database query, computation.
   If the task can be handled with `set_slots` or flow logic alone, don't create an
   action.
2. Review existing actions, slots, and responses — reuse before creating new ones.
3. Create or open the Python file under `actions/` (see "File organization").
4. Name the action with a verb after `action_` (see "Naming conventions").
5. Define the action class: `name()` returns the action name, `run()` does the work
   (see "Action class structure").
6. Read slot values from `tracker.get_slot()`, call external services, handle errors,
   then return `SlotSet` events for the flow to branch on
   (see "Working with the tracker", "Error handling", and "Returning events").
7. Register the action in the domain file under `actions:`
   (see "Domain registration").
8. Validate the project.

## File organization

Before creating new files, check the existing project layout. If the project already
uses a different convention, follow that convention instead.

By default, the action server looks for actions in a file called `actions.py` or a
package directory called `actions/`. Use `--actions my_module` when running the action
server to specify a different module.

```
actions/
├── __init__.py
├── action_scheduling.py     # actions for scheduling flows
├── action_orders.py         # actions for order tracking flows
├── action_payments.py       # actions for payment flows
└── shared/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── utils.py             # shared utilities (not action classes)
```

Group related actions by business domain. Keep helper functions (API clients, database
connectors) in separate modules so actions stay focused on orchestration.

## Naming conventions

This section proposes default conventions. If the user's project already follows
different conventions, match those instead.

- Action names: `action_` prefix, then a verb — `action_check_inventory`,
  `action_fetch_order_status`, `action_schedule_appointment` (not `action_appointment`)
- Custom ask actions: `action_ask_{slot_name}` — Rasa runs this instead of the static
  `utter_ask_` response for a `collect` step (see "Custom ask actions")
- Validation actions: `validate_{slot_name}` — Rasa runs this automatically when a slot
  is collected (see "Slot validation actions")
- Class names: `PascalCase` — `ActionScheduleAppointment`, `ValidatePhoneNumber`

## Action class structure

Every custom action subclasses `Action` from `rasa_sdk` and implements two methods:

- `name()` — returns the action name as a string. Must match the name in the domain
  and in flows.
- `run(dispatcher, tracker, domain)` — executes the action's logic. Returns a list of
  events (typically `SlotSet`).

```python
from typing import Text, Dict, Any, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet

class ActionCheckAvailability(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_check_availability"

    async def run(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        doctor_id = tracker.get_slot("doctor_id")
        preferred_date = tracker.get_slot("preferred_date")
        slots = await scheduling_api.get_available_slots(doctor_id, preferred_date)
        return [
            SlotSet("available_slots", slots),
            SlotSet("has_availability", len(slots) > 0),
        ]
```

## Working with the tracker

The `tracker` provides read access to the conversation state. In CALM assistants, the
most commonly used methods are `get_slot()` and `sender_id`:

- `tracker.get_slot("slot_name")` — get a slot value (returns `None` if unset)
- `tracker.sender_id` — unique ID of the user
- `tracker.latest_message` — dict with the last user message
- `tracker.events` — full event history

## Error handling

When an action calls external services, always handle failures. Set an error or status
slot and let the flow branch on it — don't hide error-handling logic inside the action.

```python
class ActionFetchOrderStatus(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_fetch_order_status"

    async def run(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        order_id = tracker.get_slot("order_id")
        try:
            status = await orders_api.get_status(order_id)
            return [
                SlotSet("order_status", status),
                SlotSet("order_lookup_error", False),
            ]
        except Exception:
            return [SlotSet("order_lookup_error", True)]
```

The flow can then branch on `slots.order_lookup_error` to show an error message or
continue — keeping the decision in the flow, not the action.

## Returning events

The `run` method returns a list of events that update the conversation state. In CALM,
`SlotSet` is the primary event — set boolean or categorical slots for the flow to branch
on, rather than making decisions inside the action. All events must be imported from
`rasa_sdk.events`.

| Event                  | Purpose | Example |
|------------------------|---------|---------|
| `SlotSet(key, value)`  | Set a slot value | `SlotSet("has_availability", True)` |
| `SlotSet(key, None)`   | Clear a slot | `SlotSet("selected_slot", None)` |
| `AllSlotsReset()`      | Reset all slots to initial values | `AllSlotsReset()` |
| `FollowupAction(name)` | Force a specific action to run next | `FollowupAction("action_retry")`        |
| `ConversationPaused()` | Pause the conversation (e.g. handoff) | `ConversationPaused()` |

Return an empty list if no state changes are needed: `return []`

## Using the dispatcher

The `dispatcher` sends messages back to the user, but in most cases the flow should
handle messaging via `action: utter_*` steps instead. Defining responses in the domain
and referencing them in flows gives better validation support, variations, and
rephrasing (see the `rasa-writing-responses` skill).

Use the dispatcher primarily in `action_ask_*` actions where content is dynamic (e.g.
buttons fetched from an API). If you do use it, responses are automatically added as
`BotUttered` events — do not return them as explicit events.

```python
dispatcher.utter_message(response="utter_appointment_confirmed")     # domain response
dispatcher.utter_message(response="utter_greet", name="Sara")        # fills {name} in template
dispatcher.utter_message(text="Looking up your order...")             # inline text
dispatcher.utter_message(
    text="Choose a delivery option:",
    buttons=[                                                        # CALM: /SetSlots payload
        {"title": "Standard", "payload": "/SetSlots(delivery=standard)"},
        {"title": "Express", "payload": "/SetSlots(delivery=express)"},
    ],
)
```

## Custom ask actions

When a `collect` step needs dynamic content (e.g. buttons fetched from a database),
define an action named `action_ask_{slot_name}`. Rasa runs it instead of the static
`utter_ask_{slot_name}` response. You cannot have both for the same slot — Rasa will
raise a validation error. See the `rasa-building-flows` skill for how `collect` steps
resolve responses.

```python
class ActionAskDeliveryOption(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_ask_delivery_option"

    async def run(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        options = await shipping_api.get_options(tracker.get_slot("zip_code"))
        buttons = [
            {"title": opt["label"], "payload": f"/SetSlots(delivery_option={opt['id']})"}
            for opt in options
        ]
        dispatcher.utter_message(text="Choose a delivery option:", buttons=buttons)
        return []
```

## Slot validation actions

In CALM assistants, implement slot validation as a regular `Action` subclass named
`validate_{slot_name}`. Rasa runs it automatically when the slot is collected. The action
reads the slot value from the tracker, validates it, and returns a `SlotSet` — either
with the accepted value or `None` to reject and re-ask.

For simple format or range checks, prefer domain-level `validation.rejections` or
flow-level `rejections` on the `collect` step instead (see the `rasa-managing-slots` and
`rasa-building-flows` skills). Use a validation action when the check requires external
calls or complex logic.

```python
class ValidatePhoneNumber(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "validate_phone_number"

    async def run(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        phone = tracker.get_slot("phone_number")
        if await verification_service.is_valid_number(phone):
            return [SlotSet("phone_number", phone)]
        dispatcher.utter_message(response="utter_invalid_phone")
        return [SlotSet("phone_number", None)]        # None triggers re-ask
```

## Domain registration

Every custom action must be listed under `actions:` in the domain. Actions starting with
`utter_` are auto-registered from responses and do not need to be listed.

```yaml
actions:
  - action_check_availability
  - action_fetch_order_status
  - action_ask_delivery_option
  - validate_phone_number
```

# Building Flows in Rasa

## Workflow

1. Identify the business process the user wants to implement.
2. Review existing flows, slots, responses, and actions. Reuse before creating new ones.
3. Scope the work — one file per business process, one flow per user goal
   (see "Scoping a flow").
4. Create or open the YAML file under `data/`, named after the primary flow
   (see "File organization").
5. Define the flow with a `snake_case` ID (see "Naming conventions").
6. Write the flow `description` (see "Writing descriptions").
7. Add steps: `collect` for user input, `action` for responses or invoking custom
   actions.
8. Write descriptions for `collect` steps (see "Writing descriptions").
9. Add branching with `next`/`if`/`then`/`else` where the process has decision points
   (see "Branching and conditions").
10. Extract reusable sub-tasks into child flows via `call` (see "Connecting flows").
11. Connect follow-up flows via `link` if a separate process should start after.
12. Ensure all referenced slots, responses, and actions exist in the domain
    (see "Ensure domain completeness").
13. Validate the project (see "Fixing validation errors").

## Scoping a flow

A flow represents **one business process** from the user's perspective. Use these
questions to decide whether something warrants its own flow:
1. Does a user explicitly ask for this? → yes = flow
2. Can it run independently from start to finish? → yes = flow
3. Is it a sub-task reused by multiple flows? → yes = child flow with `if: False`
4. Is it just one action at the end of another flow? → no, keep it inline

**Right-sized** flow - a single user goal with a clear start and end:

```yaml
flows:
  track_order:
    description: Lets users check the delivery status of an existing order.
    steps:
      - collect: order_id
      - action: action_fetch_order_status
      - action: utter_order_status
      # ... can also include branching, call, link steps as needed
```

**Too big** - multiple unrelated goals in one flow. Split them:

```yaml
# BAD
flows:
  shopping:
    description: Handles all shopping operations.
    steps:
      - collect: operation_type
      # ... 20 or more steps mixing order tracking, returns, payments,
      # branching, sub-flow calls — too many unrelated concerns in one place
```

**Too small** - a single step that is not a business process. Inline it:

```yaml
# BAD
flows:
  say_goodbye:
    description: Says goodbye.
    steps:
      - action: utter_goodbye
```

## File organization

Before creating new files, check the existing project layout. If the project already
uses a different convention, follow that convention instead.

By default, all flow files live under `data/`. Subdirectories are supported — Rasa
recursively scans `data/` for YAML files. Each file groups a business process with its
sub-flows:

```
data/
├── book_appointment.yml        # flow + child flows in one file
├── track_order.yml
├── transfer_money.yml
└── onboarding/                 # subdirectory for a larger domain area
    ├── register_patient.yml
    └── verify_insurance.yml
```

Name the file after the **primary flow** it contains. If `book_trip` has child flows
like `select_destination` and `choose_flights`, all three go in `data/book_trip.yml`.

Use subdirectories to group related flows by domain area when the project grows large
(e.g. `data/payments/`, `data/scheduling/`). The directory structure has no functional
impact — it's purely organizational.

## Naming conventions

This section proposes default conventions. If the user's project already
follows different conventions, match those instead.

### Flow IDs

- Use `snake_case`: `transfer_money`, `book_appointment`, `track_order`
- Start with a verb: `check_balance`, `schedule_visit` — not `flow_1` or `appointment`
- Child flows can use a prefix of the parent for clarity:
  `book_appointment_collect_patient_info`

### Flow names

The optional `name` field is a human-readable label. It has no functional impact.

```yaml
flows:
  book_appointment:
    name: "Book Appointment"
    description: Helps patients schedule a visit with their doctor.
```

## Writing descriptions

### Flow descriptions

The `description` is the **primary signal** the LLM within the Command Generator uses to
decide when to start a flow. A bad description means the flow won't trigger — or
triggers for the wrong request.

- **Be information-dense**: precisely outline the flow's purpose and scope. Avoid filler
  words. Use imperative language.
- **Use clear, standard language**: avoid unusual phrasing. Stick to universally
  understood terms.
- **Explicitly define context**: the embedding model lacks situational awareness - it
  can't read between the lines. State the domain and intent directly.
- **Clarify specialized knowledge**: if the flow references brand names or product
  names, explain what they are. The embedding model won't know.
- **Keep descriptions distinct**: if two flows sound similar, add distinguishing details
  so the LLM within the Command Generator can disambiguate.

```yaml
# GOOD — information-dense, user perspective, explicit context
book_appointment:
  description: Helps patients schedule a visit with their doctor.

track_order:
  description: Lets users check the delivery status of an existing order.

# BAD — implementation detail, vague, no context
book_appointment:
  description: Runs action_book_slot and fills the date slot.

track_order:
  description: A flow for orders.
```

### Collect step descriptions

The `description` on a `collect` step tells the LLM within the Command Generator
**what value to extract** from the user's message. Without it, the LLM within
the Command Generator only has the slot name to guess.

- Describe the **expected value**, not the question being asked
- Include **format, constraints, or valid values** when applicable
- Provide **examples** for ambiguous or structured data

```yaml
# GOOD
- collect: insurance_id
  description: >
    Insurance member ID printed on the patient's card.
    Alphanumeric, 9-12 characters (e.g. XYZ-123456789).

- collect: return_reason
  description: "Reason for the return: damaged, wrong_item, changed_mind, or other."

# BAD — no useful information / describes the question, not the value
- collect: amount
  description: the amount
- collect: email
  description: Ask the user for their email address.
```

## Slots and collect steps

By default, slots filled in `collect` or `set_slots` steps reset when the flow ends (to
`null` or to the slot's `initial_value` from the domain). To retain a slot's value after
the flow completes, list it in `persisted_slots` at the flow level. Slots set in custom
actions are persistent by default and should not be listed in `persisted_slots`.

```yaml
flows:
  return_item:
    description: Helps users return a purchased item for a refund or exchange.
    persisted_slots:
      - order_id         # kept after flow ends
      - return_reason    # kept after flow ends
    steps:
      - collect: order_id
      - collect: return_reason
      - action: action_process_return
```

A `collect` step automatically uses a response named `utter_ask_{slot_name}` to prompt
the user. Override this with the `utter` property on the collect step, or use a custom
action named `action_ask_{slot_name}` instead — but not both.

```yaml
- collect: account_type
  utter: utter_ask_secondary_account_type   # overrides default utter_ask_account_type
```

Use `rejections` on a `collect` step to validate values inline. The assistant re-asks
automatically on rejection. For complex validation, create a custom action named
`validate_{slot_name}`.

```yaml
- collect: age
  rejections:
    - if: slots.age < 1
      utter: utter_invalid_age
    - if: slots.age < 18
      utter: utter_must_be_18
```

To reset a slot mid-flow, set it to `null` in a `set_slots` step. In a custom action,
return `None`. Empty slots are not eligible for user correction.

```yaml
- set_slots:
    - amount: null
```

See the full reference for all collect step properties (`ask_before_filling`,
`force_slot_filling`, `utter`, etc.).

## Branching and conditions

Any step can branch by adding a `next` property with `if`/`then`/`else` conditions.
Conditions support operators like `and`, `or`, `not`, `<`, `>`, `=`, `!=`, `is`,
`is not`, `contains`, and `matches` (see full reference for details).

Two namespaces are available in conditions:
- `slots.` — slot values: `slots.age < 18`, `slots.plan = "premium"`
- `context.` — dialogue frame properties: `context.previous_flow_name`,
  `context.collect`, `context.canceled_name`

When `context.collect` or `context.validate` reference a slot name, wrap them in Jinja
with the `slots.` prefix: `"slots.{{context.collect}} is not null"`

When a condition leads to `next: END`, the flow completes without running further steps.
Use a `noop` step when you need a branch point without performing any action.

```yaml
- collect: membership_tier
  next:
    - if: slots.membership_tier = "premium"
      then: premium_step
    - if: slots.membership_tier = "standard"
      then: standard_step
    - else:
        - action: utter_unknown_tier
          next: END
- id: premium_step
  action: utter_premium_benefits
- id: standard_step
  noop: true
  next:
    - if: not slots.verified_email
      then:
        - call: verify_email
          next: continue_step
    - else: continue_step
- id: continue_step
  action: utter_standard_benefits
```

## Connecting flows: `call` vs `link`

Two step types connect flows together. Choose based on whether the current flow should
continue or end:

|                  | `call` | `link` |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **When**         | Sub-task needed, then parent continues | Current process is done, different one starts |
| **Control**      | Returns to parent after child completes | Current flow ends, target starts fresh |
| **Position**     | Anywhere in the flow | Must be the last step |
| **Slots**        | Child slots accessible in parent | No slot sharing — target flow is independent |
| **Cancellation** | Cancelling child cancels parent too | N/A — current flow already ended |

Example — an **orchestrator flow** that sequences `call` steps for sub-tasks and ends
with `link` to hand off to a separate process. Child flows should not overlap in the
slots they collect, so the LLM within the Command Generator can unambiguously
route user input.

```yaml
flows:
  book_trip:
    description: Guides the user through booking a complete trip with flight and hotel.
    steps:
      - call: book_flight                  # sub-task: returns here when done
      - call: book_hotel                   # sub-task: returns here when done
      - action: utter_trip_summary
      - link: process_payment              # done — hand off to a separate process

  book_flight:
    description: Helps the user search and select a flight.
    if: False
    steps:
      # ... collect destination, dates, search, select flight

  book_hotel:
    description: Helps the user search and select a hotel at the destination.
    if: False
    steps:
      # ... search hotels, select hotel

  process_payment:
    description: Handles payment for a completed booking using a saved or new card.
    steps:
      # ... independent business process, starts fresh after link
```

## Flow guards

Guards control whether a flow can be started by the LLM within the Command Generator:

```yaml
# Only start if patient is verified
view_medical_records:
  if: slots.authenticated AND slots.identity_verified

# Never start directly — only via call or link
collect_patient_info:
  if: False
```

## Ensure domain completeness

Every element a flow references must be defined in the domain (`domain.yml` or split
domain files). After writing or editing a flow, walk through each step and verify the
items below are present. Missing entries cause validation errors or silent runtime
failures.

- Every slot used in the flow → `slots:`
  (see `rasa-managing-slots`)
- Every `collect: slot_name` → `utter_ask_{slot_name}` in `responses:`
  (see `rasa-writing-responses`)
- Every `action: utter_*` step → matching entry in `responses:`
- Every custom action / validation action → `actions:`
  (see `rasa-writing-custom-actions`)
- Rejection responses → `responses:`

## Fixing validation errors

When validation fails, preserve the user's **intent** — what the flow is supposed to
accomplish. The flow steps themselves can change, but the intended behavior must not be
lost.

Never strip down a flow's intended behavior to make validation pass. If needed, fix the
domain: slots, responses, and actions to support what the user asked for.
